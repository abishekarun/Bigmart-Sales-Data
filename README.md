## Bigmart Sales Data

In this project, we try to work on [bigmart sales data]((https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/)) practice problem hosted by analytics vidhaya. All plots are plotted using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** libraries. 

The Jupyter Notebook file is [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/abishekarun/Bigmart-Sales-Data/blob/master/bigmart_sales.ipynb) for this project.
